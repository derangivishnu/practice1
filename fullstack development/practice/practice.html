    //SPREAD OPERATOR IN JS
    //Spread operator allows an iterable 
   //to expand in places where 0+ arguments 
    //are expected. It is mostly used in the
   // variable array where there is more than 
    //1 values are expected
    let Array=[1,2,3,4,5]
    console.log(Math.min(Array)) // it shows NaN

    let Array1=[1,2,3,4,5]
    console.log(Math.min(...Array1)) //it shows 1
